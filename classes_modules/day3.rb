#KEY TERMS -need to know what they are DOING

#CLASS
  #acts as blueprints

#MODULES
  #places where you can use blocks of code

#OOP means object oriented programming
  #we treat everyting as an object

# inheritance -
#   applies only to classes
#   parent to child relationship (everything a parent has a child also has)
#   can only inherit from a single parent
#     one direction (only goes down from parent to child, not child to parent)
#
# Encapsulation -
#   class
#   bundles data with the methods that use the data
#       everytime use data have to bundle it so have access to all the data
#
# Polymorphism -
#   applies to a class
#   object can take many forms
      # (object can change its data type or change to a diff type of class)

#.chomp on gets input to get rid of automatic space
#can see characters such as spaces by using print instead of puts
